        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>TeachKloud will never share personal information with third parties unless it is essential to our ability to carry out a user’s request, needed to enforce our terms and conditions, protect our rights (legal and property), that of our users, if we are legally obliged to do so or to detect security or legal issues.</p>
        <p>Your protection, security and peace of mind is our highest priority! TeachKloud is hosted with Amazon Web Services (AWS). They have over one million active users and serve top governmental organisations who trust them with some of their most sensitive information. We also provide frequent updates, providing you with the latest technology with no interruptions to you or your service. To access TeachKloud a user must be invited and confirmed by the administrator who is normally the owner or manager of the Early Years Setting. When information is shared with parents or caregivers, only the parent it was shared with has access to that information. The administrator can review, control, delete and decide what information is uploaded and who has access to it. Passwords used to access TeachKloud are all encrypted.</p>
        <p>TeachKloud also has an SSL Certificate. SSL keeps sensitive information sent online encrypted, so that only the intended recipient can understand it. In addition to encryption, an SSL Certificate also provides authentication. This means you can be sure that you are sending information to the right person!

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
